## Setting up streaks

You can setup streaks via the dock, in the "Streaks" section.

1. Select the character or type from the dropdown.
   If you select a Killer, the Killer's name will be used for the streak name. If you select a Survivor, "Survivor" will be used for the streak name, unless you pick a custom name. If you select "Other", you can enter a custom name.
2. Toggle "Show on stream" to make the streak visible in the source.
3. For Killer and Survivor characters, toggle "Show image" to show their character portrait in the source.
4. Optionally, in "Record/Target Label", enter a label for the target/record badge (e.g. "WR" or "PB").
5. Optionally, in "Record/Target Value", enter a value for the target/record badge.
6. Click the "+" button to increase the streak value by one. If the streak value is the same as the target value, the target value will also increase by one.

You can rearrange streaks by clicking and dragging on a streak.

## Setting up a scoreboard

You can setup a scoreboard via the dock, in the "Scoreboard" section. You can change the color of the scoreboard and upload a custom logo to replace the Dead by Daylight default (e.g. a team logo). Logos/icons with a transparent background work best.

## Customizing the design

In the dock, click "Settings". You change the font style, font size, and font color (streaks only). To decrease the size of the whole overlay, transform the source in OBS. Avoid increasing the size of the overlay in OBS as this may cause the overlay to become distorted. Use the font size setting to increase the size of streaks.

## Update

Streak Overlay for Dead by Daylight will automatically install updates when they become available via GitHub.
