## Install

> **Note**
> This app is in alpha and may be unstable. Save any information you enter in another location.

**Streak Overlay for Dead by Daylight** is available for Windows 11.

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/superdazed/dbd-streak-overlay/releases/latest).
2. If your browser warns that the app isn’t commonly downloaded, select More options (three dots), then select Keep.
3. If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen appears, select the arrow next to Delete, then select Keep anyway.
4. Open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
5. After installation is complete, follow the provided instructions to set up your streaming software.

## Features

**Streak Overlay for Dead by Daylight** provides a browser source URL and a custom dock URL.

- Use the browser source URL to add the overlay to your broadcast scenes.
- Use the dock to configure the overlay and update it in real time.

### Set up streaks

Set up streaks in the dock under the **Streaks** section.

1. Select a character or type from the dropdown list.

    - If you select a **Killer**, the Killer’s name is used as the streak name.
    - If you select a **Survivor**, the streak name defaults to _Survivor_ unless you enter a custom name.
    - If you select **Other**, enter a custom name.

2. Turn on **Show on stream** to display the streak in the overlay.
3. For Killer and Survivor characters, turn on **Show image** to display the character portrait.
4. (Optional) In **Record/Target label**, enter a label for the badge, such as WR or PB.
5. (Optional) In **Record/Target value**, enter a target or record value.
6. Select + to increase the streak value by one. If the streak value matches the target value, the target value also increases by one.

To reorder streaks, drag a streak to a new position.

### Set up a scoreboard

Set up a scoreboard in the dock under the Scoreboard section. You can change the scoreboard color and upload a custom logo to replace the default Dead by Daylight logo (for example, a team logo). Logos with a transparent background work best.

#### 1v1 mode

Toggle "1v1 Mode" to add timers to the scoreboard. Once enabled, use the  <kbd>`</kbd> (backtick) key to start and stop the timers. The timer keybind works on a loop:

- first press: starts Player 1/Survivor's timer
- second press: stops Survivor timer and swaps player positions (i.e. Survivor becomes Killer)
- third press: starts Survivor timer
- fourth press: stops Survivor timer, highlights the longest time in green, adds a point to the player with that time
- fifth press: resets timers to 0:00.00

### Customize the design

In the dock, select Settings to change the font style, font size, font color (streaks only), overlay position, and overlay padding.

To resize the entire overlay, resize the source in your streaming software. Avoid increasing the size there, as it may cause distortion. To make streaks larger, use the font size setting instead.

## Update

**Streak Overlay for Dead by Daylight** automatically installs updates when they become available on GitHub.
